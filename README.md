## Array operations and algorithms
Array operations are - insertion ,deletion, update, searching (linear, binary), sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap, counting, radix, bucket ), two pointer algorithm, sliding window 
### Algorithms:
  1. Two pointer
  2. Siding window

## Linked list
Linked is a collection of data (node) where each node contains an value and a reference to next node. Last node is pointed to null.
Allocate memory one by one.
contiguous data structure - single section of memory block will be allocated.
### Types:
  1. Singular linked list
  2. Doubly linked list
  3. Circular linked list
### Algorithms:
  1. Slow fast


## Stack
It is an linear data structure which uses LIFO and FIFO

### functions

**empty()** - returns True if stack is empty else False - O(1)
**size()** - returns size of stack - O(1)
**top()** - top most value in the stack (last value in the array) - O(1)
**push(a)** - insert an element at last (top) - O(1)
**pop()** - deleted the top most element in the stack - O(1)
**peek()** - get the top most element without deleting it.

### Types
  1. Monotonic increasing stack
  2. Monotonic decreasing stack
